POC DESIGN DOCUMENT
Trello Card Completion ? SharePoint Automation
Version: 0.1 (POC)     |     Status: Draft     |     Date: February 2026

1. Objective
Validate that a Power Automate flow can detect when a Trello card moves into a designated completion list, retrieve enriched card data from the Placker API (comments, checklist completion, close date), and write a structured record to a corresponding customer folder in SharePoint — with no manual intervention.

SCOPE
Single Trello board, single target list (e.g. 'Done'). One SharePoint document library with pre-existing customer folders. No new infrastructure provisioned.


2. Tools & Prerequisites
All tools below should be available before starting. Confirm access to each before building the flow.

Tool / Resource
What You Need
Power Automate
Access to premium connectors — confirm your M365 license includes the HTTP connector (requires Power Automate Premium or per-flow plan)
Trello
Admin access to the target board. Note your Board ID from the board URL.
Placker
API key — generate from your Placker profile page under API settings
SharePoint
Write access to the target document library. Confirm folder naming convention matches how you plan to route files
Postman (optional)
Recommended to test Placker API calls before building the flow — saves debugging time inside Power Automate

LICENSE CHECK
Power Automate's HTTP action (used to call the Placker API) requires a Premium license. Check Settings > View My Licenses in Power Automate before building.


3. Architecture Overview
The flow is entirely event-driven. It fires when Trello reports a card movement, enriches the data via a single Placker API call, composes the output, and writes to SharePoint. There is no scheduled polling and no intermediate file storage.

Trello connector detects card moved to target list

HTTP call to Placker API — get card comments, checklists, dates

Build CSV row using Compose actions and string formatting

SharePoint connector writes file to customer folder



4. POC Build Steps
Follow these steps in order. Each step has a validation check before moving on — this is your TDD mindset applied to flow building.

Step 1 — Verify Placker API Before Touching Power Automate
Do this first. It will save you significant debugging time later. Use Postman or your browser to test the Placker API directly and confirm the response contains the fields you need.

Action
Detail
Get your Placker API key
Profile page ? API settings ? Generate key
Find your card ID
Open a completed card in Placker, copy the ID from the URL
Test GET card endpoint
GET https://placker.com/api/v1/cards/{cardId} with header: Authorization: Bearer {your-api-key}
Confirm fields present
Look for: card name, description, checklist items + checked status, comments array, date last modified

MENTOR NOTE
This habit of testing your API independently before wiring it into automation is called 'contract testing'. You're verifying the API delivers what you expect before building anything on top of it. Senior devs do this instinctively.

Step 2 — Create the Power Automate Flow

#
Step
Details
1
New Instant or Automated Flow
Go to make.powerautomate.com ? Create ? Automated cloud flow
2
Set Trigger
Search for Trello connector ? Select 'When a card is moved to a list' ? Connect your Trello account ? Select your Board and target List (e.g. Done)
3
Add HTTP Action
Add action ? HTTP ? Method: GET ? URI: https://placker.com/api/v1/cards/{cardId} ? Headers: Authorization = Bearer {your-api-key} ? Use dynamic content to insert the Card ID from the trigger
4
Parse JSON
Add 'Parse JSON' action ? Content = HTTP body ? Generate schema from a sample response you captured in Step 1
5
Compose Output
Add Compose action ? Build your CSV row using dynamic fields from parsed JSON: card name, close date, comment count, checklist summary
6
Create SharePoint File
Add SharePoint action 'Create file' ? Site: your SharePoint site ? Folder path: /CustomerFiles/{customer name} ? File name: {card name}_history.csv ? File content: Compose output

Step 3 — Define Your Output File Structure
Decide what your CSV record should contain before building the Compose step. Keep it simple for the POC — you can always add columns later.

Column
Source in Placker API Response
Card Name
card.name
Date Closed
card.dateLastActivity or card.closed date
Description
card.desc
Comments (count)
Length of card.actions array filtered to commentCard type
Last Comment
First item in comments array ? text field
Checklist Items Total
Sum of all checklist items across card.checklists
Checklist Items Complete
Sum of checked items only
Board Name
card.board.name (for context)

POC SIMPLIFICATION
For the POC, write one row per card to a new file. Don't worry about appending to an existing log yet — that adds complexity around file locking. Get the single-card write working first.


5. POC Validation Checklist
Before calling the POC a success, verify each item below. These are your acceptance criteria.

Check
Expected Result
Placker API returns card data
Raw JSON response visible in Postman with all required fields populated
Flow triggers on card move
Moving a test card into the target list starts the flow — visible in flow run history
HTTP call succeeds inside flow
Run history shows HTTP action with status 200 and a populated body
Parse JSON produces usable fields
Dynamic content picker in subsequent steps shows individual fields from the card
CSV row is correctly formatted
Compose output shows comma-separated values with no null fields or broken structure
File appears in SharePoint
File is visible in the correct customer folder with expected filename
File is readable
Open in Excel — columns and data are clean and correctly mapped


6. Known Risks & Mitigations

Risk
Mitigation
Power Automate license does not include HTTP connector
Check license before building. If blocked, the fallback is to use the Trello native connector only and accept limited data — confirm what fields it returns natively.
Placker API does not return full comment/checklist history
Test in Step 1 before assuming. If data is missing, supplement with a direct Trello API call using the same card ID.
SharePoint folder path does not match card data
For POC, hardcode the customer folder path. Routing logic (matching card to customer folder dynamically) is a Phase 2 concern.
CSV append vs. new file per card
POC creates a new file per card. Appending to a shared log is deferred — it introduces file locking complexity not appropriate for day-one validation.
Trello connector polling delay
Power Automate's Trello connector polls on a schedule (not true real-time). Expect up to a 5-minute delay between card move and flow trigger. This is acceptable for POC.


7. Out of Scope (Phase 2)
These are valid future requirements but explicitly excluded from the POC to keep tomorrow's effort focused.

• Dynamic customer folder routing based on card label, member, or custom field
• Appending records to a shared history log rather than creating new files
• Error handling and retry logic for failed API calls
• Multi-board or multi-list monitoring
• Email or Teams notification on file creation
• Full comment thread capture (POC captures last comment and count only)


8. POC Success Criteria

DEFINITION OF DONE
A card moved to the target Trello list results in a readable CSV file appearing in the correct SharePoint folder within 10 minutes, with no manual steps taken after the card move.

If this criterion is met, the POC is successful and Phase 2 scoping can begin. If any step fails, the run history in Power Automate will show exactly which action failed and why — this is your debugging starting point.
